Bogos Binted is a sarcastic take on poetry, because I often find myself frustrated trying to interpret the meaning of poems. It reshapes an obscure and nonsensical meme into a dynamic, animated conversation that can be displayed on an ESP32. To see it for yourself, clone this repo and then flash bogos_binted.c onto an awaiting ESP32.
